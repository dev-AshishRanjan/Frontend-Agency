# Frontend Implementation Standards

## Architecture

- Prefer the host project's existing framework, routing, styling, component, and data patterns.
- Keep components small enough to test and review, but avoid needless abstraction.
- Use typed contracts for reusable data structures when the codebase supports them.
- Keep design tokens centralized and avoid one-off raw values in repeated UI.
- Use semantic HTML first, ARIA only when native semantics are insufficient.

## Accessibility

- Preserve heading order and landmarks.
- Provide visible labels for form fields.
- Ensure icon-only controls have accessible names.
- Preserve keyboard navigation, focus order, and visible focus states.
- Check contrast for text, icons, controls, and focus indicators.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Performance

- Optimize images with correct dimensions, modern formats, lazy loading where appropriate, and meaningful alt text.
- Avoid unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
- Prefer server-rendered or statically generated marketing surfaces when feasible.
- Keep animation work on transform and opacity where possible.
- Avoid layout shifts from late-loading media, fonts, or dynamic content.

## SEO

- Use unique titles and meta descriptions.
- Use canonical URLs where appropriate.
- Keep crawlable links for key navigation.
- Use structured data only when accurate.
- Ensure the primary content exists in the delivered HTML for public marketing pages.
